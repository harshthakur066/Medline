# Medline

Medline is an online solution to the problem of connectivity of doctors and patients in remote areas or during any pandemic.

Medline gives easy access to doctors for patients who are disturbed by factors like distance and availability and hence makes available to every patient in need of doctor anywhere anytime.

Our main focus during the Covid-19 is to get special attention to the patients at the initial stage.

Since everything is moving to online doctors should also get a chance. As during pandemic, it is much safer to get treatment online rather than risking to go outside.


## Project Flow

Our app focusses on two different types of users patients and doctors.

### Patients

Patients have a simple auth and on their dashboard they will get a list of doctors so they can choose on their own by also referring to their details and checking out the available slots.

Later on, they can pay through Razorpay portal and will be redirected to the chat area of the doctor once the payment is successful there is also an option for a video call on the slots booked for the particular patient.

For a video call, for now, both patient and doctor have to enter the same roomId manually due to some issues during development.


### Doctors

During signup, they have to provide their licence id for security reasons and the specialization with their charges for each patient.

Once the doctor is authenticated he/she will get the pending messages from the patient and booked slot. From their onwards, they can communicate through each other.


## Business Idea

The main business model of this app is through fees. Medline takes the two per cent finderâ€™s fees for every patient connected to the doctor.

Once the patient makes the payment and the video call between the doctor and patient is made successfully the consultation charges are transferred to the doctor.
